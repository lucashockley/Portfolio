        I'm Lucas Hockley, and I'm a 19 year old student from Cambridgeshire. Currently I'm studying
        Computer Science at the University of Leeds, and I've been doing web development for around
        2 years now.

      <p class="text-center py-8">
        I work on everything from the initial design of a site, all the way through to deploying it
        for the world to see. Frontend engineering is certainly what I'm best at; I love the mix of
        creativity and problem solving that brings a site to life. I still do all of the boring
        stuff too, though! I've built tailored backend services from the ground up, and I've also
        used content management systems that make for easily editable web pages.
